Outwit three players in this classic card game where strategy and luck go hand-in-hand!
Three cards are dealt face down to each player. Seven additional cards are then dealt to each player. Choose three cards to use at the end of the game, while the remaining cards are played. Play a card that is either the same or higher rank in the pile. A 2 will reset the pile to whichever card you chose, and a 10 will burn and discard the pile! Don't have a card that matches or beats the pile? Pick up the pile! Once all cards are discarded, the three chosen at the beginning of the game are played. Finally, play the three cards that are face down. Hope you are lucky!

The player to discard all cards first wins the game!
